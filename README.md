# AIS-trajectory-annotation
This technique accepts trajectories of vessels collected through Automatic Identification System (AIS) and identifies critical points along each course, i.e., it annotates selected point locations with a particular characterization (stop, turn, communication gap, slow motion, etc.) in order to capture important changes across the route.
